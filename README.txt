## Instructions
- Begin the game by entering your name (ensuring it is between 3-15 characters and does not contain any special characters or whitespace)
- using the slider choose your desired number of rounds and game difficulty.
- game difficulty refers to how long the distance of the track is. The shorter the distance, the harder the game will be.
- Next select 3 towers to add to your inventory. Take notice of reload speed, resource amount, and resource type to ensure you pick the best towers
- Once you have finished setting up, you have a choice to go to the shop: to buy additional towers or tower upgrades
- view your inventory: optionally selling your towers or upgrades for more money, or changing your towers status
- play a round: before you play the round you may upgrade any of your towers, and choose a new round difficulty level.
- in between rounds you can go back to the shop or inventory and make changes as needed
- after you finish all of your rounds you can exit the game
